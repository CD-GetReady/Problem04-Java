Tariq started a second job walking dogs! 
Normally he can walk one dog at a time but he can walk two if the dogs are the same size. 
Provided an array of dog sizes, how many walks will Tariq have to make?

For example, if the dogs Tariq had to walk are sizes [1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3] then it would take him 4 walks. He could walk 
two size 1 dogs together, two size 3 dogs together, the size 2 dog by itself, and the remaining size 3 dog by itself.
